# telegram-bot-api
A simple Golang bot for the Telegram Bot API

Really simple bot for interacting with the Telegram Bot API, not nearly done yet. 

All API responses are implemented as structs, only some method calls have been added. 
There's a very simple plugin in `bot.go` right now. You can find config options in the code fairly easily. 

Hopefully code quality will improve as this project progresses.
