# Golang Telegram bindings for the Bot API

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/src.foxpaw.in/Syfaro/telegram-bot-api?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/src.foxpaw.in/Syfaro/telegram-bot-api)

Bindings for interacting with the Telegram Bot API, not nearly done yet.

All methods have been added, and all features should be available.
If you want a feature that hasn't been added yet, open an issue and I'll see what I can do.
